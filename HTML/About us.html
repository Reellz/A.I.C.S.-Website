        <h2 class="section-title">Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>
            In today's globalized society, many families struggle to find an educational
            institution that aligns with their values while providing rigorous academic
            programs. Public and conventional private schools often fail to incorporate 
            spiritual growth and moral education, resulting in students who may excel academically
            but lack a strong ethical foundation.
