                A.I.C.S is an institution that aims to prepare Godly leaders, Focused innovators, and Responsible members of society.
                In a world that is advancing so quickly and is introducing people to its new set standards, some of which are having 
                a negative impact in society and are derailing the society from the Lord and the purpose for which man was created.
                We aim to achieve these goals through spiritual guidance of students, daily devotion, and discipleship using the ACE 
                Curriculum.
